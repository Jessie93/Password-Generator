# Create a Password Generator 

## Description
The Password Generator is a web application that allows an employee to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected. The application presents a series of prompts for password criteria such as length of password (at least 10 characters but no more than 64), and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters). Once the prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page. The user interface is designed to be clean, polished, and responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes. The application was created using JavaScript and is available to view through a deployed page link. To run the application, users can clone the repository and open the index.html file in their browser.
